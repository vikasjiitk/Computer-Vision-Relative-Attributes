### Code
Our project consisted of three parts - **feature extraction** and **two ranking models** (RankSVM and RankNet).  
Each part has separate folder in _code/_ directory with their separate README file.  
See README file of each part for the dependencies and commands to execute the code.  

1. **Feature extraction** -  in code/cnn folder. It is implemented in keras. The details are in the readme in that folder.

2. **Ranking using RankSVM** - in code/RankSVM folder. It is implemented in matlab. The details are in the readme in that folder.

3. **Ranking using RankNet** - in code/RankNet folder. It is implemented in python. The details are in the readme in that folder.
